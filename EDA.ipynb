# Data-Exploration-on-NYC-ABNB
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.


#importing necessery libraries for future analysis of the dataset

#using pandas library and 'read_csv' function to read BlackFriday csv file as file already formated for us from Kaggle

ab = pd.read_csv('AB_NYC_2019.csv')

#after looking at the head of the dataset we already were able to notice some NaN values, therefore need to examine missing values further before continuing with analysis

#looking to find out first what columns have null values
#using 'sum' function will show us how many nulls are found in each column in dataset

airbnb.isnull().sum()


#replacing all NaN values in 'reviews_per_month' with 0

airbnb.fillna({'reviews_per_month':0}, inplace=True)

#examing changes
airbnb.reviews_per_month.isnull().sum()


#let's proceed with examing some interesting categorical unique values

#examining the unique values of n_group as this column will appear very handy for later analysis
ab['neighbourhood_group'].unique()


#examining the unique values of neighbourhood as this column will appear very handy for later analysis
ab['neighbourhood'].unique()

#examining the no of unique values of neighbourhood 
ab['neighbourhood'].nunique()
